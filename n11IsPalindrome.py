Question 11: IsPalindrome
Given a doubly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome

Time Complexity: O(n), we walk in from both ends once, each element visited once at most.
Space Complexity: O(1), only a pair of pointers.

Technique:
Doubly-linked-list forward/backward two-pointer

Approach:
Because we have both 'next' and 'prev' pointers, we can compare the first and last
nodes directly:
- Start left at the head and right at the tail.
- While left and right havenâ€™t crossed, compare their data.
    If any mismatch occurs: not a palindrome.
- Move left forward and right backward each step (both pointers head towards the center).
- If every pair matches, the list is a palindrome.

Note: UCP doc allows assuming only int values, hence not tested for other input data types
